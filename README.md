## About Me

Hello, my name is Corbin Couger and I'm from Indianapolis, IN. I'm a recent Bellevue University grad where I recieved my Master's in Data Science and previously a Butler University grad, getting my Bachelor's in Statistics with a focus on Data Science. I've been able to do a lot of fun projects both personally, educationally, and professionally. I'm very passionate about the math that drives powerful data science models. I enjoy using Python and R to build different Regression models, Classification models, Clustering Models, and more. Using my background in statistics I have become very well-rounded for completing full data projects.

Personally, I have a few passions/hobbies that are not related to data. I really enjoy learning about dog pyschology. i.e. dog behavior, training, and care. I love dogs and like knowing how their brains work. Though I have not gotten a dog yet since my graduations, I do plan on getting a Cane Corso soon! I also have a hobby in gaming. Nerding out here for a second, I've built my own PC (computer) and enjoy making it better and casually gaming with it. It also is great for data science projects because it can run ML models very efficiently. Lastly, I have a passion for movies. I like to watch movies that make me think deeper and also that leave me either speechless, in fear, laughing, or honestly any emotion.

With all of my passions and education combined, I feel; creative, analytical, and confident in my work and am excited for you to check it out!

Within this portfolio you will find some of my favorite projects throughout my data science journey. A lot of these are consisted of work I did in my graduate program when obtaining my MS in Data Science. I'm proud of these projects and am glad they can represent my enjoyment for data science and all the different techniques I enjoy. Please give a look to the other README files as they give some good insight to what each project is. Thank you!
