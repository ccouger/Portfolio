# Summary of Student Gender Gap Graduation Analysis

In this project, two classmates and I were out to discover if there were a statistical difference between the mean graduate counts between men and women. Using some hypothesis testing we were able to discover some meaningful and interesting results. Utilizing R Studio and some fun pacakges, this project report came out to be very neat and answered our research questions we had.
