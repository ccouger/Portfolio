# Airline Safety Infographic

### created by Corbin Couger

This infographic is a combination of a couple weeks worth of finding data, exploring the data, combining different data sources, and then creating visualizaitons with it. The overall goal was to prove to the public that air travel is much safer than expected. When comparing this form of travel to automobile for example, airplanes are much safer.

Utilizing Tableau, PowerBi, Matplotlib in Python, and ggplot2 in R Studio; I was able to create useful visualizations that provided general information to the public. This is something that would be hung or projected in an airport for people to read on their own.

This project is just a glimpse of what I can do in the data visualization space! Thanks for checking it out
