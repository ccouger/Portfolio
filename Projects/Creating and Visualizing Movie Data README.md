# Summary of 'Creating and Visualizing Movie Database' Project

Being one of my favorite projects in the portfolio, the creating and visualizing of a movie database was challenging to do. In this lengthy, yet interesting report, I go through my process of utilizing 3 separate data sources (raw .csv file, an API, and web scraping) to create a movie database. There are many different datapoints that went into this and each source needed cleaning and preparing before I was able to join them together in a SQL database. I utilize a lot of Python data manipulation and SQLLite to make a database. I discuss my process, goals, and reasoning for the creating of the database and why I made the visualizations I did.
