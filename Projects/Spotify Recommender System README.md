# Summary of Spotify Recommender System

Ever find yourself searching for new music? Whether it be for your personal or business needs? Well I built a handy recommender system using Cluster Analysis and Spotify data that will provide you statistically similar songs to the ones you input. This project utilizes a lot of my skills in Python and Cluster Analysis. I use a really cool method called K-means clustering to get the job done. In future instances of this project I would like to implement a Spotify API to get the data.
