# Summary of Stock Predictions Time Series Analysis

In this project I created a Time Series model on some stock data that I called from an API. The user types in a stock ticker and then the API calls to get data based on that stock. This project is something where I did not get the exact results I was hoping for. This is something that can happen in Data Science and was definitely a learning experience for me.

Check it out [here](https://github.com/ccouger/ccouger.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Stock%20Predictions%20Time%20Series%20Analysis.pdf) and see more of my skills in calling APIs, Python modeling, and more!
