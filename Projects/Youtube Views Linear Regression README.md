# Summary of Youtube Views Linear Regression

In this project, I take on predictive analytics with one of my favorite models to build, Linear Regression. I really enjoy watching Youtube and have enjoyed that people make a business and career out of it. Most of the money generated for the creators is through views and ad revenue. So, I wanted to create a statistical model to determine and predict the number of views a video would get based on the different characteristics on a video.

This project is another fun one that highlights my different skills in statistics and data science. Check it out!
