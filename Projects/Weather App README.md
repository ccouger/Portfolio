# Summary of Weather App - API

Getting a better understanding of API and the documentation that comes with most APIs, I created a useful Python application that generates weather information based on user input. This code calls the API based on a location/zipcode a user inputs and returns the weather for that area. I really like APIs and their usefulness in Data Science.

Check out my code [here](https://github.com/ccouger/ccouger.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Weather%20App%20-%20API.py), and get an understanding of my skills in calling an API using Python!
