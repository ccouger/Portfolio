## About Me

Hello, my name is Corbin Couger and I'm from Indianapolis, IN. I'm a recent Bellevue University grad (2023), where I recieved my Master's in Data Science and previously a Butler University grad (2021), getting my Bachelor's in Statistics with a focus on Data Science. I've been able to do a lot of fun projects personally, educationally, and professionally. I'm very passionate about the math that drives powerful data science models. I enjoy using Python and R to build different Regression models, Classification models, Clustering Models, and more. Using my background in statistics I have become very well-rounded for completing full data projects.

Personally, I have a few passions/hobbies that are not related to data. I really enjoy learning about dog pyschology. i.e. dog behavior, training, and care. I love dogs and like knowing how their brains work. I also have a hobby in gaming. Nerding out here for a second, I've built my own computer and enjoy making it better and casually gaming with it. It also is great for data science projects because it can run ML models very efficiently. Lastly, I have a passion for movies. I like to watch movies that make me think deeper and also that leave me either speechless, in fear, laughing, or honestly any emotion.

With all of my passions and education combined, I feel; creative, analytical, and confident in my work and am excited for you to check it out!

### Recent Experiences

During my time as an undergraduate, I got the pleasure of working as a Summer Intern for a non-profit energy company, MISO. This experience was my first time, professionally, getting to work with real-world data and using Python, R, and SQL to clean data and create a ML model. I had a lot of fun with this and it was a great learning experience.

After earning my Bachelor's, I first got hired on as a Data Analyst for Humana Inc. where I worked on an internal IT team that tested new technologies and softwares before deploying them company wide. I was in charge of collecting feedback and user expereience data where I analyzed whether or not these technologies should get deployed. I also was in charge of determining the population of candidates for these testing pilots. I enjoyed this experience a lot as I got to sharpen my skills in SQL and user experience.

Currently, I am working as a Staff Analyst for Myers & Stauffer. I do many different projects with client data, typically including millions of rows of data spanning numerous columns wide. The typical work includes me validating data loads, analyzing historic price data to re-calculate economicly friendly prices, and extracting different populations of data to start an analysis. This experience is further sharpening my SQL skills and am hopeful that I get to start working with Python/R here soon in this role.

## Contents

Within this portfolio you will find some of my favorite projects (located in the 'Projects' folder, or click [here](https://github.com/ccouger/Portfolio/tree/main/Projects)) throughout my data science journey. A lot of these are consisted of work I did in my graduate program when obtaining my MS in Data Science. I'm proud of these projects and am glad they can represent my enjoyment for data science and all the different techniques I enjoy. Please give a look to the other README files as they give some good insight to what each project is. Thank you!
