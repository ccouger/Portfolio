# Summary of 'Ad Click Through Logistic Regression' Analysis

Within this project, I wanted to address and answer the business question of 'what makes a customer purchase through an advertisement?' Almost every company today that is selling a product creates ads. This project helps companies determine who is buying, and also predicts who will buy from the ad. I utilized a fun and popular binary classification method, Logistic Regression, along with a dataset that contained many different features on each customer. Have a look through the project and see the code, content, and results of my analysis!
